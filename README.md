### Details:
#### This script is written to work in a Ubuntu system with an iptables firewall and openvpn. 
#### The first two systems added must be the hosts of each fireteam.
#### Every time you want to invite players to the fireteam you must stop the firewall first. Once the fireteam is ready start the firewall back up.
#### This is tested to work on PSN, it may work on Xbox and Steam. If you encounter any issues feel free to make an issue.
#### Also please do not run this on your personal computer it will clobber your firewall rules. It is meant to be run on an isolated vps/cloud instance.
